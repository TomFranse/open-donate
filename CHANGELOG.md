## [2026-01-12]

### Changed

- **Centralized Button Styling**: Refactored button styling to be fully centralized in theme
  - Removed all `color` props from button usages across the application

    - `variant="contained"` → uses primary color (main actions)
    - `variant="outlined"` → uses white color (secondary actions)
    - `variant="text"` → uses primary color (text buttons)
  - All button styling is now managed in `defaultTheme.ts` - components only specify variant
  - Ensures consistent button styling across the entire application

- **Outlined Button Hover Effect**: Enhanced outlined button with animated gradient slide effect
  - Outlined buttons now have a smooth gradient slide animation on hover (matching contained buttons)
  - Gradient transitions from transparent to white with sliding animation
